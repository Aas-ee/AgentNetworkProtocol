## 1. Foundation of Security: Asymmetric Encryption

The security of did:wba is primarily built on asymmetric encryption. This encryption method uses a key pair:

- Private Key: Held only by the identity owner, used for signing
- Public Key: Can be publicly shared, used for signature verification

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Identity Owner"
        PrivateKey["Private Key"]
        PublicKey["Public Key"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Signing Process"
        Data["Original Data"]
        Sign["Digital Signature"]
        PrivateKey -->|Sign with Private Key| Sign
        Data -->|Calculate Hash| Sign
    end
    
    subgraph "Verification Process"
        VerifyData["Received Data"]
        VerifySign["Received Signature"]
        Result["Verification Result"]
        PublicKey -->|Verify with Public Key| Result
        VerifyData -->|Calculate Hash| Result
        VerifySign --> Result
    end

    style PrivateKey fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style PublicKey fill:#9ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Sign fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Result fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px 
```

This encryption mechanism ensures:
1. Only the private key holder can generate valid signatures. The private key must remain confidential.
2. Anyone can verify signature authenticity using the public key. A successful verification confirms the signature was generated by the private key holder.
3. The private key cannot be derived from the public key. The key pair is generated together, but the public key cannot reveal the private key.

## 2. DID Document Security Assurance

From the above process, two key points ensure did:wba's security:

1. Private key confidentiality must be maintained.
2. Verifiers must obtain the correct public key.

In did:wba, users maintain their private keys, while public keys are contained in the DID Document. The DID Document is stored on the user's DID server and can be accessed by anyone through a URL generated from the DID using the HTTPS protocol.

Fundamentally, as long as users can obtain the correct DID Document, they can verify the other party's identity. In did:wba, we recommend users use DNS-over-HTTPS for domain resolution, access DID Documents via HTTPS, employ secure encryption algorithms, and implement strict certificate validation.

## 3. Identity Verification Process Security

did:wba's identity verification process incorporates multiple security mechanisms:

### 3.1 Request Signing Mechanism

Each authentication request contains:
```
Authorization: DID <did> Nonce <nonce> Timestamp <timestamp> VerificationMethod <key-id> Signature <signature>
```

Components include:
- Nonce: Random number preventing replay attacks
- Timestamp: Ensures request timeliness
- Signature: Signs critical information

### 3.2 Security Measures

1. **Replay Attack Prevention**:
   - Unique nonce generation for each request
   - Single-use nonce policy
   - Server-maintained blacklist of used nonces

2. **Timestamp Validation**:
   - Limited request validity window
   - Prevention of historical request replay
   - Server-side timestamp reasonability check

3. **Domain Validation**:
   - Server domain inclusion in signature data
   - Prevention of signature reuse across services

4. **Signature Verification**:
   - Signature integrity verification
   - Authorized key usage confirmation
   
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server
    
    Note over C,S: Initial Authentication Request
    C->>S: GET /protected-resource
    S-->>C: 401 Unauthorized<br/>WWW-Authenticate: Bearer nonce="xyz987"
    
    Note over C: Generate Signature:<br/>1. Get Timestamp<br/>2. Sign with Private Key
    
    C->>S: GET /protected-resource<br/>Authorization: DID <did> Nonce <nonce><br/>Timestamp <timestamp> VerificationMethod <key-id><br/>Signature <signature>
    
    Note over S: Verification Process:<br/>1. Check Nonce Usage<br/>2. Verify Timestamp<br/>3. Verify Signature
    
    alt Verification Successful
        S-->>C: 200 OK + Access Token
        Note over C,S: Subsequent Requests with Token
        C->>S: GET /protected-resource<br/>Authorization: Bearer <token>
        S-->>C: 200 OK + Resource
    else Verification Failed
        S-->>C: 401 Unauthorized
    end
```

## 4. Additional Security Considerations

### 4.1 Private Key Compromise

In case of private key compromise, users should promptly generate a new key pair and update their DID Document. Since the DID Document is stored on the user's DID server, updates can be made immediately.

### 4.2 Regular Key Rotation

Private keys should be rotated regularly to maintain security.

## Conclusion

did:wba's security is founded on modern cryptography, utilizing asymmetric encryption, secure DID Document storage and verification processes, and regular private key rotation to ensure reliable and secure identity verification.

Its fundamental principle remains rooted in the robust security of asymmetric encryption. At the infrastructure level, it relies on existing mature systems like DNS, Public Key Infrastructure, and HTTPS protocols rather than introducing new infrastructure.
