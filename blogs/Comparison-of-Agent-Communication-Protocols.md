# Comparative Analysis of Open-Source Agent Communication Protocols: MCP, ANP, Agora, agents.json, LMOS, and AITP

During the development of agent communication protocols, I have collected various existing protocols in the industry and conducted an analysis using OpenAI's deepresearch. The analysis covers aspects such as target problems, key technologies, applicable scenarios, technical architectures, compatibility and extensibility, open-source ecosystems, and future development prospects. While some details may not be entirely precise, this analysis serves as a valuable reference.

Our team initiated the design and development of an open-source agent communication protocol early last year. As one of the earliest teams researching this field, we have clearly observed a significant increase in attention and interest over the past two to three months.

We warmly invite you to follow our open-source project and join our community. Whether you are an individual developer or a company in the AI industry, your participation is highly welcomed. The vitality of agent communication protocols depends on collaborative industry efforts.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### Target Problem
Focused on **Large Language Model (LLM) Context Integration**:
- Addresses the difficulty of integrating AI models with external data sources and the fragmentation of context.
- Provides a unified standard enabling LLMs to conveniently and securely access various content repositories, tools, and environments, breaking data silos and avoiding customized integrations for each data source.

### Key Technologies
**Open RPC Framework**:
- Defines standard request/response/notification message formats based on JSON-RPC 2.0.
- Introduces a **capability negotiation** mechanism, allowing clients and servers to dynamically agree on supported protocol features (including fine-grained sub-features), enhancing flexibility and extensibility.
- Currently supports local bidirectional streaming communication (e.g., standard IO pipes, HTTP+SSE streaming output); remote communication features such as identity authentication and service discovery are planned.
- Conceptually serves as a "USB-C interface" for AI applications.

### Applicable Scenarios
**AI Application Integration**:
- Suitable for scenarios requiring embedding LLMs into business systems and rapidly connecting to multiple data sources and tools, such as enterprise knowledge base Q&A, programming assistants integrating with code repositories/IDEs, and office assistants accessing calendars and emails.
- Through MCP, developers can provide LLMs with unified interfaces to databases, cloud documents, development environments, etc.
- Currently primarily used in **local or intranet** environments for agent integration with internal tools; with future remote support, it can extend to cross-service cloud agent integrations.

### Technical Architecture
**Client-Server Architecture**:
- MCP treats the AI model as the client and external data sources as MCP servers.
- Both sides exchange predefined JSON messages, similar to RPC calls.
- The transport layer currently supports **local pipes** (standard input/output streams) and **HTTP persistent connections with SSE** (Server-Sent Events unidirectional streams) for request/response or streaming messages.
- Each transport method has specific message exchange requirements.
- Currently limited to local or intranet communication to ensure simplicity and security (no remote identity issues without external connections).
- Future plans include remote connectivity capabilities involving authentication, authorization, service discovery, and stateless operations.
- Thus, MCP architecture favors **one-to-one** communication between models and resource services, similar to plugin calls, and does not handle multi-agent routing.

### Compatibility and Extensibility
**Easy Integration**:
- MCP employs common technologies like JSON and HTTP, ensuring high transparency and ease of local deployment. Claude and other models already support MCP clients.
- Anthropic has open-sourced the specification and SDK, providing MCP server examples for popular systems (Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, etc.) for straightforward integration.
- Due to its open nature, other large models (including open-source LLMs) can implement MCP, making it cross-model compatible.
- Currently lacking remote invocation capabilities, but future additions of authentication and networking will enable adaptation to microservices and cloud APIs.
- Its **capability negotiation** mechanism allows adding new functional modules without breaking compatibility, enabling existing clients to negotiate and utilize new features, thus ensuring good extensibility.
- Overall, MCP integrates easily with existing systems (especially REST-style services) and can serve as a standard component for LLM plugins.

### Open Source and Ecosystem
**Anthropic Open Standard**:
- MCP specifications and partial SDK implementations are publicly available.
- Anthropic has integrated local MCP server support into the Claude desktop application, demonstrating data integration.
- The initial ecosystem includes early adopters such as Block and Apollo, and developer tool companies like Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph are collaborating to enhance code-related agents using MCP.
- The community maintains MCP specifications on GitHub, and third-party tools (such as open-source MCP visualization management clients) have emerged.
- Released at the end of 2024, the ecosystem is still in its early stages but has attracted significant attention, with strong support and active discussions (e.g., Reddit developer discussions on MCP breakthroughs).
- MCP is released under an open license, encouraging community contributions to transport mechanisms and server implementations.
- With future remote capabilities and broader LLM compatibility, the MCP ecosystem is expected to expand into an "LLM plugin marketplace."

### Future Prospects
**Short-Term Leadership, Long-Term Expansion Needed**:
- Backed by Anthropic and early adopters, MCP is likely to become one of the **de facto standards** for LLM tool integration in the near term.
- As remote functionalities mature, MCP could rapidly expand its applicability and establish a strong presence in enterprise applications.
- Its strengths lie in **simplicity and practicality**, developer-friendliness, and strong ecosystem support from major companies.
- However, in the long run, MCP currently lacks decentralized identity and multi-agent interaction capabilities, potentially limiting its role in large-scale agent networks.
- If Anthropic and the community continue iterating and add identity authentication modules, MCP may evolve into a more general-purpose protocol.
- Overall, MCP has a bright future in the **LLM context integration** domain, potentially becoming the "USB interface of the AI era," but it will need to collaborate with other protocols to achieve the broader vision of interconnected agents.
