[proposal]Support for authentication methods based on the W3C DID specification `did:wba`

## Motivation and Context

We have added an experimental authentication scheme, `did:wba`, to MCP.  

We believe `did:wba` can serve as an excellent complement to OAuth 2.0 for the following reasons:  
1. `did:wba` provides security equivalent to OAuth 2.0.  
2. `did:wba` supports decentralized identity authentication, offering better interoperability.  
3. `did:wba` requires fewer interactions and has a simpler process.  

The changes in this code are based on a branch that has not yet been merged into the main branch (PR link: [https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/101](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/101)). We will update our code accordingly if there are any changes to this branch.

## How Has This Been Tested?
This proposal has not yet been implemented in a client/server.

## Breaking Changes
Users do not need to update their code or configuration. As an experimental scheme, the server or client can choose not to support it.

## Types of changes
- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)
- [ ] Documentation update
